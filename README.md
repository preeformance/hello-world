# hello-world

Greetings,

My name is Pree and I'm leaping into the tech industry. 
My background includes various elements of nerd stuff 
from live event production and modifying html so my MySpace page looked cool (trust me, very cool) 
to tabletop RPGs and video games. 
I'm here to create, collaborate, and connect. 
Nice to meet you!
